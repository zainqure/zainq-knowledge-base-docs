# Template for Knowledge Base Docs Websites

This repository is a template to create a knowledge base docs website: 

1. The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages. 
2. After a simple setup, you will only edit Markdown files, commit changes, and push the commits to GitHub. 
3. Your website will automatically update when you push your changes to GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> `content/` — The directory where your knowledge base docs exist.
> 
> *(This directory can be opened in Obsidian, Visual Studio Code, or any other Markdown editor. Obsidian is recommended.)*

## IMPORTANT

- Only create/edit the knowledge base docs in the `content/` folder. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your Markdown files will live in the `content/` folder, and your knowledge base docs website will be built from the files in the `content/` folder. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not edit any other files in the repository unless you know what you are doing. Any Markdown files or content you manage outside the `content/` folder will not be included in your website.
