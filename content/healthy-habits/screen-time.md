# Managing Screen Time

Phones, computers, and TVs are a big part of life today. While screens are useful, too much time on them can harm our health.

## Problems With Too Much Screen Time
Spending long hours on screens can cause eye strain, poor sleep, and less time for exercise. It may also affect our mood.

### Ways To Reduce Screen Time
- Take breaks every hour  
- Use apps to track screen use  
- Spend more time outdoors  
- Avoid screens before bed

## Healthy Balance
1. Set a limit on daily screen use  
2. Replace screen time with hobbies like reading or sports  
3. Use screens for learning, not just scrolling
