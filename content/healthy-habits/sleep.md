# Importance of Sleep

Sleep is one of the most important parts of a healthy life. When we sleep, our body and brain get the rest they need. Without enough sleep, we feel tired, moody, and less focused.
## Why Sleep Is Needed

Sleep helps the body repair itself, gives us energy, and helps the mind stay sharp. A good night of sleep makes it easier to think, study, and make good choices.
### Benefits of Good Sleep
- Better memory and focus  
- Less stress and better mood  
- Stronger body and immune system  
- Easier to stay at a healthy weight
